Implementations 2 approximation algorithm for the generalized steiner netwerk problem

## Requirements

* [gcc](http://gcc.gnu.org) :Standard compiler 
* [glpk](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glpk/): for lp solver
* [lemon](http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon/wiki/Downloads): lemon graph library

Tested with versions 

* gcc 4.2.1    Standard compiler 
* glpk 4.35,   NB: make sure to use this version, for lemon's compatibility
* lemon 1.2.4  A c++ library to 

## Instalation
I will give the whole range of commands that are necessary. This approach has been tested for mac, linux and ubuntu. It is not guaranteed that it works for microsoft. It assumed that the reader has previously compiled and executed code from the command prompt.

First install glpk-4.35. by typing the following, the parenthesized (.gz) might be required. For mac it is not required.

* cd ~
* mv Downloads/glpk-4.35.tar(.gz) .
* tar xvf(z) glpk-4.35.tar(.gz)
* cd glpk-4.35
* ./configure
* make
* sudo make install 

Then install lemon-1.2.4. by typing the following, the parenthesized (.gz) might be required. For mac it is not required.

* cd ~
* mv Downloads/lemon-1.2.4.tar(.gz) .
* tar xvf(z) lemon-1.2.4.tar(.gz)
* cd lemon-1.2.4
* ./configure
* make
* sudo make install 

##Running the algorithm

When this is done, the code is obtained cloning the following reporistory

"git clone https://github.com/jhdvries/steiner-algorithm.git"

After compiling the code, you can execute either.

* final_complete_main.cxx    
Solves the generalized steiner network on a complete graph with 10 nodes, cost 1 for all edges and connectivity requirement 1 for all nodepairs. 

* final_incomplete_main.cxx    
Solves the generalized steiner network on a incomplete graph with 10 nodes, cost 1 for all edges and connectivity requirement 1 for all nodepairs.

* final_petersen_main.cxx    
Solves the generalized steiner network on the petersen graph with 10 nodes, cost 1 for all edges and connectivity requirement 1 for all nodepairs.

Note that the instance on the incomplete graph, which is randomly generated for final_incomplete_main.cxx, might not have a feasible solution. If so, simply execute the programm again. 

The output is the solution to the LP relaxation and it's value and the approximated solution and it's value.

##Running options

There are several options for adjusting the instances that are solved by the algorithm. 

### Adjusting the size of the graph, not possible for petersen graph.

Open final_complete_main.cxx, on line 16, there is function generate_complete_graph(&g,10) adjust the size of the graph by changing 10 to the desired number of nodes. final_incomplete_main.cxx can be adjusted in the same way. Note that instances with more then 15 nodes might not be executable.

### Adjusting the cost function

Open final_complete_main.cxx, on line 20, there is function fill_cost_constant(&c, &g, 1); There are two ways to adjust the cost assignment to the node edges. 

1. replace the 1 with a desired edge costs m for all edges

2. replace constant with random, and change 1 to a desired edge cost upperbound m. The costs will now be randomly assigned integers ranging from 1 to m.  

### Adjusting the requirement function 
Open final_complete_main.cxx, on line 24, there is function assign_connectivity_constant(&r,&g,1). There are two ways to adjust the requirement on the node pairs. 

1. replace the 1 with a desired connectivity requirement m for all nodepairs

2. replace constant with random, and change 1 to a desired connectivity requirement upperbound m. The requirements will now be randomly assigned integers ranging from 1 to m.  

The same can be done for either final_incomplete_main.cxx and final_petersen_main.cxx. Note that having m>3 is always infeasible for the petersen graph as all nodes have 3 outgoing edges.

After any adjustments, compile the code again and execute the adjusted file.
